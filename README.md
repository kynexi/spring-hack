# 📚 Scroll2Learn – AI-Powered Microlearning Reels

**“Brain rot with benefits.”**  
Scroll2Learn is the AI-powered study tool that turns your class presentation into addictive, short-form, scrollable content. Think TikTok meets school — where you _actually_ learn while doomscrolling.

## 🚀 What Is It?

Scroll2Learn lets students upload a presentation (PDF, PPT, lecture notes) and transforms it into a series of AI-generated reels with:

- 🧠 Bite-sized educational summaries
- 🎤 AI voiceovers (yes, even your professor’s voice if you dare)
- 🎥 Gen-Z background content (Subway Surfers, ASMR slime, etc.)
- 📲 Smooth scrollable UI, just like TikTok or Instagram Reels

You scroll. You learn. You win.
